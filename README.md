<h1> Computer vision project </h1>

Welcome to the computer vision project that uses OpenCV to detect Images. I have worked on this project to take a glimpse of how Computer vision is used in industry. 
This project uses Python with trained data from OpenCV to operate.

<h2> How its works </h2>
Its works on using trained data of Opencv and using it to check wheater the image is matching with trained data or not.

<h3> Necessary things </h3>

We are going to use pip to install Opencv so make sure you are having pip in your system.

For checking and updating pip you can use <code> pip install --upgrade pip </code>
Now you can install the Opencv Liabrary <code> pip install opencv-python </code>

As you have istalled now you just have to go through code and that's it.

Well here I am linking the actual repository of Opencv <code> https://github.com/opencv/opencv </code>

And yes all the things are mentioned in the comment of code!
